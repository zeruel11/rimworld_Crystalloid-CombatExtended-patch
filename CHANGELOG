R1: Added new NeutralPrism, Preserver, and Specter to patches. Changed old Prisms to follow rewrite values. CrystalHumanlike follow new values
R2: Finished all weapon and ammo types. Psionic weapons have infinite ammo but longer cooldown. May have to rebalance this a bit. Also for now ammo recipes follow their equivalent charged ammo in CE, might consider changing to use charged ammo instead to reduce cluttering.
