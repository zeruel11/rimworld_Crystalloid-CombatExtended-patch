## This file describes what changes between old crystalloid (B17 version) and new crystalloid rewrite 1.0 version in relation to the patch. Mostly this is just a reminder for myself since AtomicRavioli didn't mention the changes. Considering getting in touch.

PawnDefs
- Pawn Crystal changed to Constructs, new Preserver and Crystal Spectre
- PawnKinds_CrystalSlave and PawnKinds_CrystalSpacer defs are now combined into PawnKinds_Refugees
- PawnKinds_CrystalLoyalist changed into PawnKinds_Loyalist and are mostly unchanged, CrystalloidFlayer no longer exists
- PawnKinds_CrystalRebel now divided into PawnKinds_Outlander, PawnKinds_Mercenary, and PawnKinds_Pirate. CrystalIndependent faction are also divided into OutlanderCivil and Pirate (or is that new?).
