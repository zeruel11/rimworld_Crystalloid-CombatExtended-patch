# Crystalloid
Patches the Crystalloid mod to work with Combat Extended

For now this patch only enables Crystalloid race to use CE compatible weapons. Crystalloid weapons are still NOT compatible. This means that the new factions are still not patched (they use non-CE weapons) and the weapons itself still uses vanilla values - in another word, unusable with CE
